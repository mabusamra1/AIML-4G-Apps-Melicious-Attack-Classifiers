## Context

The goal of this project is to define an inteligent self-adaptive mechanism for securing 4G/5G cellular networks which detects/prevents attacks launched by cellular devices. The mechanism includes data exploration and quality check of the network generated data and select the best model based on the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines). The dataset used is related to network intrusion detection generatde over 5G wireless network and comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humera11/5g-nidd-dataset). 



# 1 Business Understanding



## 1.1 Background



With the large number of new connections, features, and services introduced, the 4th and 5th wireless generations (4G/5G) technologies reflect the development of mobile communication networks and is here to stay for the next decade. The multitude of services and technologies that LTE/5G incorporate have made modern com- munication networks very complex and sophisticated in nature. This complexity along with the incorporation of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides the opportunity for the attackers to launch intelligent attacks against the network and network devices. These attacks often traverse undetected due to the lack of intelligent security mechanisms to counter these threats. 

Therefore, the implementation of real-time, proactive, and self-adaptive security mechanisms throughout the network would be an integral part of 4G/5G as well as future communication systems. Large amounts of data collected from real networks will play an important role in the training of AI/ML models to identify and detect malicious content in network traffic. This work presents 5G Network Intrusion Detection Dataset (5G-NIDD), a fully labeled dataset built on a functional 5G test network that can be used by those who develop and test AI/ML solutions. The work further analyses the collected data using common ML models and shows the achieved accuracy levels.  Although the dataset was collected from running test traffic on 5G networ it still can be used for 4G/LTE as well.

The following approach will be taken as part of implementing the self-adaptive security mechanism:

- Binary classification - identify cellular device originated messages as 'benign' or 'melicious' taking the binary classification approach 
- Multi-Class classification - identify melicious message 'attack type' taking the multi-class classification approach using one-versus-one strategy

The Binary classification allows the system to detect a threat while the multi-class classification allows the system to take specific steps to neutralize the threat.



## 1.2 Business Goals and KPI

The business objective is to find the best models to identify and detect malicious content in network traffic. This model will help cellular service providers providing secure and reliable applications to thier customers, improving business outcomes.

A sample set of size 50K was randomly selected to represent the 1.2M entries, because of the cost of processing 1.2M entries in terms of high CPU processing power and more importantly the time it takes (3+ weeks) to evaluate and select the suitable model.



Upon closely examining the data, following features were removed since they were not relevent to 'Y' (i.e., they were intriduced by Argus tool as part of message flow generation) :

- Unnamed, Seq, Cause, and Attack Tool.

  Note: the index was reset.



Here is want the samlple data of the randomly selected 50K entires post removal of features not related to 'Y':

***Here are some additional details on target columns - <u>'Label' and 'Attack Type'</u>:***

**1 - *DoS Attacks* Types -** A DoS attack is one of the most common attacks that can occur in a network. The aim of this attack is to slow down or completely shut down a target making it inaccessible to legitimate users. Flooding techniques and malicious content injection are some of the common methods to lunch a DoS attack. The network or a node will eventually undergo resource exhaustion and deny the nonmalicious usersâ access as a result of a DoS attack. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the 5G networks, DoS attacks impose a vital threat in 5G which may target the network nodes, devices, and applications.

â | **a) *Benign Traffic:*** The benign traffic profile includes protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). 

â | **b) *ICMP Flood:*** Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood attacks use ICMP echo requests to flood a target at a very high frequency. Ideally, an ICMP echo reply follows the echo request to the same Internet Protocol (IP) address. In this type of attack, the target will send back echo replies to massive amounts of ICMP echo requests. The higher frequency of echo requests also leads to a higher frequency in the rate of response which eventually overwhelms the network and makes the services unavailable for normal users.

â | **c) *UDP Flood:*** In a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flood attack, attacker sends UDP packets at a higher rate. Since UDP is a connection-less protocol, it is possible to send a large amount of traffic. As the UDP packets arrive at the target destination, the reply is a âDestination Unreachableâ packet if no associated application is found. Over time, as a higher amount of UDP packets are received and responded to, the system eventually becomes nonresponsive.

â | **d) *SYN Flood:*** SYN flood attack is a result of the exploitation of the TCP three way handshake. In a typical TCP communication between two nodes, the source nodes sends a SYN packet to the desired node for the initiation of the connection. The destination node replies with a SYN ACK to acknowledge the SYN packet. Finally, the source sends another ACK to acknowledge receiving the SYN ACK, completing the three way handshake. In a SYN flood attack, the attacker does not perform the final step of the TCP handshake, therefore leaving the connection half open. The transmission of SYN packets at a higher frequency will leave large amounts of ports half open for a certain period and eventually the receiver will be exhausted once all ports are occupied preventing access for legitimate users.

â | **e) *HTTP Flood:*** HTTP flood attacks target the application layer. It is a popular method for DoS/DDoS attacks due to its proven effectiveness in mimicking normal human behavior and thereby staying undetected. We used Python based Goldeneye tool to conduct the HTTP flood attacks. To perform the application layer attacks, we deployed a web server at the victim Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) instance. The target was an Apache2 web server deployed in MEC.

â | **f) *Slowrate DoS:*** Another exploitation of the application layer to conduct DoS attacks is the use of slow rate attacks. In terms of the speed and the number of packets directed at the target, it is comparatively different from other forms of DoS attacks. This slow nature of the traffic makes it harder to detect. In this exercise, we conducted two different forms of slow rate DoS attacks. As the first one, we performed slowloris attack through a python script. The attack establishes several connections with the targeted web server and maintain them for a longer period. We performed this by sending HTTP partial headers continuously to keep the connections open without completion. The web server waits for the connections to complete which might never occur. The opening of a large number of such connections will eventually lead to resource exhaustion. 

â | In another case, the attacker sends slow POST requests to a web server. The POST requests comprises packets that specify a larger packet size in the header field, but the actual packet has a lesser size. The server then waits for the completion of the whole packet size specified in the header field.



**2 - *Port Scans*** - A port scan usually precedes an actual attack to identify opportunities for attacks via open ports. Typically, port scans send requests to a targeted range of ports in a targeted host and observe the response. The response is sufficient to determine the status of a specific port in most cases. In some instances, deeper knowledge such as the operating system of the target may also be discovered. Port scan is an efficient way to determine exploitable hosts in a network before the execution of attacks. The dataset contains attack data from different port scans such as the SYN scan, TCP Connect scan, and UDP scan.

â | **a) *SYN Scan:*** The SYN scan uses part of the three way handshake in TCP connection establishment to discover open ports. The attacker sets the SYN flag in a TCP packet and sends to the target. If the targeted port/s is ready for a TCP connection, it returns a response packet with SYN and ACK flags set. This means the scan indicates an *open* port to the attacker. Ports that are not ready to establish a TCP connection send a RST packet indicating a *closed* port. As the attacker determines the state of the port from two packet flows, attacker cease the execution of the next step of the three way handshake. However, to terminate the connection the attacker may send an RST packet to the target once the information on the status of the port is collected. If not, the target will keep sending packets with SYN and ACK flags set until a response is seen from the attacker. Other than *open* or *closed* ports, a *filtered* port may imply that a firewall is blocking the packets or the host is not reachable.

â | The incomplete three way handshake in SYN scan makes the scanning process quite fast in comparison to other available techniques. The SYN scan is one of the most popular scanning techniques.

â | **b) *TCP Connect Scan:*** Similar to SYN scan, the TCP connect scan exploits the TCP handshake to perform the scanning process. However, the three way handshake is fully completed therefore, the time taken to scan the ports is higher compared with SYN Scan. Conversely, attackers may not need the same level of privileges to execute a TCP connect scan as they require for SYN scan.

â | The execution of the TCP connect scan is similar to SYN scan with the addition of the completion step in the three way handshake. This means that the two initial packet flows (SYN flag set packet and SYN ACK flags set packet) take place for an *open* port. Subsequently, the target replies with a packet set with ACK flag to complete the three way handshake. Although the opening of a TCP connection also offers the potential for data exchange, the attacking operating system makes sure the connection is terminated as soon as it detects that one has been made. In the event of a *closed* port, target sends a RST packet to the host similar to the SYN scan. *Filtered* ports may also exist in this scenario.

â | **c) *UDP Scan:*** UDP scan transmits UDP datagrams to the targeted ports of the targeted host. The attacker sends the UDP packets with a missing payload to ports that are not UDP. For UDP ports, a protocol-specific payload will exist. In UDP scan, the status of a port is defined based on the response of the target or the unresponsiveness of the target. As nonUDP ports receive a UDP datagram without a payload, the probability of getting a proper response is minimum. An *open | filtered* state is likely from such ports which indicates either a firewall is blocking the packets or packets are simply been forwarded from TCP/IP stack towards a listening application and discards them as invalid. Because of this, it might be challenging to precisely identify whether a port is open for nonUDP ports. In the case of UDP ports, a response may be recognized as a clear indicator of an *open* port. A port is judged to be closed if the response is an ICMP port unreachable error.





## 1.2 Early Data **Exploration** and Data Quality Check

Next step is to check the quality of the data. For example, due to the presence of categorical features,  the summary of the data is checked for the types in each category. By doing this, the step needed for data cleaning or to be transformed is identified. For example, checking for missing/empty values.

# 2 Data Preparation

This section provides information on data preparation and cleaning, to allow for analysis as part of this case study and the future case studies covering predictions.  



## 2.1 Data Transformation

Following categorical features were transformed:

**a) [Binary Classification Approach] (Level 1) Target Feature - 'Label' -** Ordinal encoding method used

{'Benign': 0, 'Malicious': 1}.

**b) [Multi-class Classification Approach] (Level 2) Target Feature - 'Attack Type' -** Ordinal encoding method used

{'Benign': 0, 'UDPFlood': 1, 'HTTPFlood': 2, 'SlowrateDoS': 3, 'TCPConnectScan': 4, 'SYNScan': 5, 'UDPScan': 6, 'SYNFlood': 7, 'ICMPFlood': 8}.

**b) Remaining -** 

For the rest of the catagorical data, One-Hot-Encoding method was used.



## 2.2 Data Cleansing

In this step, the data is handled based on the problem found during the data understanding phase. Based on the finding, the following steps are executed:

a) Dropped columns that had >= 77% of missing values. 

b) After step (a), removed rows with NULL values.

c) There was no duplicate data to address upon executing (a) and (b). Note: Original data did have duplicate data.



## 2.2 Final Data (post cleaning and transformation)

The shape data after cleaning : (49992, 37)

In Figure 2, the disbribution of  'Label' distribution between 'benign' or 'melicious' (binary classification) is provided.

# 3 Data Understanding - Deep Analysis

This section provides information about deeper exploration and analysis of the data conducted, in preparation for future machine learning model.



## 3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, the results of exploring and visualizing insight from the data is captured.



### 3.1.1 Categorical Data 

Figure 4 provides a view of the categorical features and the category distribution per feature in percentage.

![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/bar_categories.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/bar_categories.png) 
 
**Figure 4 - Categorical Features**

Note:  In Figure 4, the disbribution of the feature categories is presented, providing a hint as to which feature and associated categories may influence 'Label' outcome as 'benign' or 'melicious' (level 1 classification).  



 ![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png) 

**Figure 5 - Distribution of Benign and Malicious messages across Proto categories**

Figure 5 provides a view of the message Proto categories and their association to 'Label' classification. For example, 'icmp' protocol based messages have a very high likelihood of being benign. Where as 'tcp' protocol based messages are highly likelihood of being malicious.



 ![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/Proto_benign_malicious_distribution.png) 

**Figure 6 - Comparitive view - Malicious Vs Benign distribution per Proto category**



Figures 5/6 provide a view of the message protocol categories and their association to 'Label' classification. For example, 'icmp' protocol based messages have a very high likelihood of being benign. Where as 'tcp' protocol based messages are highly likely to be of malicious type.



 ![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/State_benign_malicious_distribution.png) 

**Figure 7 - Malicious Vs Benign distribution per State category**

Figure 7 provides a view of the session state categories and their association to 'Label' classification. For example, 'RST', 'FIN' states have a very high likelihood of being malicious. Where as 'ECO' protocol based messages are highly likely to be of benign type.



 ![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/sDSb_benign_malicious_distribution.png) 

**Figure 8 - Malicious Vs Benign distribution per sDSb category**

Figure 8 provides a view of the sDSb categories and their association to 'Label' classification. With the exception of 'cs0', all sDSb types are associated with messsages that are benign. Messages associated with 'cs0' has little less than 2/3 chance of being malicious.



From the distribution presented above, it is clear the following features influence the 'Y' (target feature Label) outcome:

a) From the target feature Label (as 'Y') prespective, the cleaned data is not as imbalanced.

b) From the target feature Attack Type (as 'Y') prespective, the cleaned data is imbalanced. 

b) Over half of the malicious messages are of type 'UDPFlood'.

c) From the 'Proto' feature perspective, message of category type 'tcp' have roughly higher than 95% chance of being malicious. Message of category type 'udp' have roughly higher than 50% chance of being malicious

d) Messages not associated with feature category of type sDSb ''cs0' are benign.



### 3.1.2 Addressing Business Questions

Following were some of the business questions answered based on the analysis of the data.

**1) In the case of malicious messages, what is the most used protocol to launch an attack? - focusing on specific protocol to help prevent majority of the malicious attacks.**

Figure 9 Malicious messages distribution across all Proto feature categories. 



 ![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/attack_type_dist.png) 

**Figure 9 - Malicious message distribution across Proto category types**



Over 70% of the malicious message are based on protocol of type 'udp' . The other protocol use is 'tcp', which is less than 10% of the overall malicious messages.  



**2) Identify the features of an application/appliance to detect/prevent majority of the attacks? **

Lets identify malicious message associated protocol/network features that standout. 



 ![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/proto_attacktypes.png) 

**Figure 10 - Breakdown of malicious message across Attack Type per network protocol**



From Figure 10, it is clear that:

A)  Majority of the attacks are of UDP protocal based UDPFlood attack method

B) In the case of malicious messages using TCP protocol, the attack method utilized are HTTPFlood and SlowrateDoS.



 ![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/sdsb_attacktypes.png) 

**Figure 11 - Breakdown of malicious message across Attack Type per destination diff serve byte value (sDSb)**



From Figure 11, it is clear that:

A)  Majority of the attacks are of sDSb cs0 attacks utilizing SlowrateDoS attack method.

B) Remaining malicious messages utilize SYNScan, TCPConnectiotScan, UDPScan, HTTPFlood, and SlowrateDoS attack methods.



 ![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/state_attacktypes.png) 

**Figure 12 - Breakdown of malicious message across Attack Type per connection state**



From Figure 12 provides the following information:

A)  Majority of the malicious message associated with state REQ & INT use UDPFlood attack methods. 

B) Remaining fewer malicious messages are associated with SYNCScan, TCPConnectScan, UDPScan, SYNCFlood, HTTPFlood, and SlowrateDoS attack method.



In conclusion, application/appliance that can scan UDP protocol to detect anomalies associated with messages using  sDBs and State  can help detect and prevent majority of the malicious attacks.



NOTE: 

1. Please refer to section 2.1 for details description of malicious categories.
2. Please refer to section 2.1 for description of the attack methods.



### 4.1.3 Numerical Features Evaluation 

The numerical features were evaluated via correlation matrix and features with > 80% correlation were dropped. 

```
Features to Drop: ['RunTime', 'Mean', 'Sum', 'Min', 'Max', 'SrcPkts', 'TotBytes', 'SrcBytes', 'DstBytes', 'sMeanPktSz', 'SrcLoad', 'DstLoad', 'Rate', 'SrcRate', 'DstRate']
```

Following are the results after dropping the identified features. 



 ![AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/Images/proto_benign_malicious.png at main Â· mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers](https://github.com/mabusamra1/AIML-4G-Apps-Melicious-Attack-Classifiers/blob/main/Images/pairplot_numeric_features_label.png)

**Figure 15 - Heatmap of features aganist 'Label' and 'Attack Type'**



### 4.1.3 Observation 

Insights derived from the Initial analysis are: 

a) The most used attack method is UDPFlood followed by HTTPFlood

b) Network protocols per the attach method used are UDP and TCP.

Per the distribution of sDSb Attack Type category, the destination diff serve byte value may help with easily separating messages between benign versus malicious.



### 5.0   Modeling  

The goal of the modeling phase is to identify the best model to be used for identify the key features that dynamically help identify malicious messages. The classification will be executed at two levels:

1. Level 1 - Binary classification where the 'Y' (target feature) is 'Label'

2. Level 2 - Multi-class classification where the 'Y' (target fetaure) is 'Attack Type'.

   

This phase will have four tasks:

**a) Select modeling technique**: Determine which classicication algorithms to try (e.g. KNN,
DT).

**b) Generate test design**: Pending the modeling approach, split the data into training, test, and validation sets.
**c) Build model**: Build and executing the selected models.
**d) Assess model**: Interpret the model results based on the pre-defined success criteria, and the test design.



### 5.1   Model Selection 

The modeling technique is as follows:

### 5.1.1   Pre-process 

The pre-process is defined to transform the categorical features to numerical values,  retaining the original information. As a result, "Ordinal Encoder" was executed against the 'Label' and 'Attack Type' feature since the categorical values had inherent order to it.

For the rest of the features, "OneHotEncoder" was used because the categorical values did not have inherent order or ranking.

Here are the results:

### 5.1.2   Modeling Technique 

The models that will be evaluated are:
-  Dummy Classifier as Baseline
-  Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- SVM  

Following steps were taken to deterime the best model using default hyperparameters:

a) Use of GridSerachCV to help identify the best hyperparameters for each model.

b) Evaluate the accuracy and perfromance of each model. 

The model that performs the best will be selected to identify the important features that contribute to identifying malicious messages and the attack type. 

Becasue the data is imbalanced in the case where 'Y' is the Attack Type, the F1-sore was used.

### 5.1.3   Testing Technique 

The pre-processed data will be split, of which 70% will be randomly allocated for taining and 30% will be allocated for testing.

### 5.1.4   Model assessment using hyperparameter

GridSearchCV will be used for each model to find the optimal hyper parameters.



### 5.1.5   Refining Data -Addressing the Multi-Cornality for Logistic REgression

Per the results presented in Figure 15, following features were further identified to have correlation above 80% were dropped. 

```
Features to Drop: ['Proto_udp', 'sDSb_cs0', 'sDSb_ef', 'State_ECO', 'State_URP']
```

Base on the results presented in Figure 20, following are the important features identified by the model:

a) Offset  
b) sTtl
c) State_INT
d) sHops
e) TotPkts
f) Proto_icmp
g) Dur
h) Load

These features are identified as important features based on binary classification algorithm and accordingly needs to be analyzed further. Using this results of the analysis, the data can be optimzed to improve the execution of the models.



Lets examine 'Offset', 'sTtl', 'Dur' from the important features selected by the model:

### 6.0   Deployment



### 6.0.1   Summary

- For binary classification, target feature is balanced
- For multi-class classification, target feature is imbalanced. Therefore, examined F1-score.
- All of the models performed well and much better than the baseline. The best model for binary classification is DT while the best model for multi-class classification is KNN.
- DT and KNN performance was very close, therefore for deployment, KNN will be used to predict 'Label' at level 1 and 'Attack Type' at level 2.



### 6.0.2   Recommendation

Further analysis needs to be conducted to improve the performance of the models in terms of execution time. In the case of multi-class classification where the target feature is 'Attack Type', a technique need to be formulated such that when the data is down sampled the result is a balanced data set.



### 7.0   Next Steps

To achieve practical implementation, the code and algorithm must be optimized to process large amounts of data (in Megabytes) in very short period of time (in minutes). Further analysis is required to reduce the number of input features evident from results in section 5.3.3 and 5.2.3.
